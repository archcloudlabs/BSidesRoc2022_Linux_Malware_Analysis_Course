## About The Course
According to [recent industry reports](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/linux-malware-sees-35-percent-growth-during-2021/), Linux focused malware has grown in the past year by over 30%. With the rise in Cloud Computing it’s no surprised that attackers are looking beyond traditional Windows environments to profit off of illicit access.  This course was given at BSides Roc 2022 in order to provide students with a broad exposure of techniques and tools to identify, triage and analyze a faux-incident in a CTF style event.
