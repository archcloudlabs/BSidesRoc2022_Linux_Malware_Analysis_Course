## Carving Up Data - Containers
A member of the DevOps team said they found a new container running in production that's not from their container registry.
Can you take a look and see if you can find anything?

* https://hub.docker.com/u/apt585

First lets download the image
``` sh
$> docker pull apt585/apache
```

Next, let's view the entrypoint or command that starts when the container is started


``` sh
$> skopeo inspect --config docker://apt585/apache:latest
```

Then, open up the image with 
``` sh
$> dive apt585/apache
```

* When was this container created?
* What packages were installed in this container?
* What is the working directory for this container?
* What is the command executed when this container starts?

Are there any files that look interesting? Copy them out from the container and analyze them

* [reference](https://docs-stage.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/create/#extended-description )
``` sh
$> docker create -ti --name dummy IMAGE_NAME bash
$> docker cp dummy:/path/to/file /dest/to/file
$> docker rm -f dummy
```

## Bonus Round 1 - Looking at Disks
[Digital Corpora](https://digitalcorpora.org/) is a website that hosts disk images, memory dumps, network packet captures, etc... for forensics education work.
To make this "course" repeatable in the future, I'm leveraging one of their files which is available via their public S3 bucket. The specific image we're using is from 
[DFRWS 2021 challenge](https://dfrws.org/forensic-challenges/) and more information can be found [here](https://dfrws.org/dfrws-2021-challenge/#part2).
While the disks distributed are typically in [Encase](https://security.opentext.com/encase-forensic) format, for the purproses of carving out data, it will work for our usecase.
To list files from the bucket within the vagrant machine

``` sh
$> aws s3 ls s3://digitalcorpora/corpora/ --no-sign-request
```

Let's download the Raspberry Pi image due to it's size.
``` sh
$> aws s3 cp s3://digitalcorpora/corpora/dfrws/challenge-2021/2_Raspberry_Pi_mSD.zip . --no-sign-request
$> unzip  2_Raspberry_Pi_mSD.zip
```

Next, let's extract files 

``` sh
$> binwalk -e 2_Raspberry_pi_mSD.
$> binwaE001_Carta_MicroSD_Stampante_3D.e01
```

*Note, in real world scenearios never operate on the REAL disk*

Next, we'll manually mount the filesystem and hash all of the files within the file system structure and compare it to the extracted files
and idenify deleted files. Change the appropriate file paths for the find command to match what you've mounted in your file system.

``` sh
$> find /path/to/imaged/disk -type f -exec sha256sum {} +/ > extracted_files.txt;
$> mkdir /tmp/tmpmount;
$> mount disk.img /tmp/tmpmount;
$> find /path/to/mounted/disk -type f -exec sha256sum {} +/ > mounted_files.txt;
$> diff extracted_files.txt mounted_files.txt
```

* What files were recovered via extraction that are not present in the file system?
* Leverage plaso to create a timeline of events that happened in this disk.


## Bonus Round-2: Sleuthkit & Autopsy
Beyond the class room, obtain the latest version of [Autopsy](https://sleuthkit.org/autopsy/) and explore some of the Digitial Corpora/DFRWS Challenges.
