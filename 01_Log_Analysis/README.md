## A Needle in A Haystack

The corresponding Apache log file in this directory has numerous entries, some of which are malicious.
It's all too common to run across log files where you'll have to slice and dice a text file to parse out valuable data.
For your first lab, you're tasked to write a script to do the following in the language of your choice:

1. Identify unique count of IPs in this file.
2. Parse out entries that are non-200 status code
3. Perform lookups against a 3rd party API for data enrichment. 
* Is there any historical threat intel?

```bash
# Get unique IPs
uniqueips=$(cat access.log  | cut -f 1 -d ' ' | uniq -c | awk '{print $2}')

# query 
for ip in $uniquieips; do
    results=$(curl https://pulsedive.com/api/explore.php?q=$ip) 
    score=$(echo $results | jq '.results|.[].risk')
    countrycode=$(echo $results  | jq '.results|.[].summary.properties.geo.countrycode')
    echo -e "[$(date -Im)] $ip ($countrycode): $score"
    sleep 10;
done
```
