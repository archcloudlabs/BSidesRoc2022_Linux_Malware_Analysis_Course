It's far too time consuming to manually analyze every single suspicious sample that
comes into your life. Stand on the shoulders of giants and leverage YARA rules to help quickly triage
things that may be interesting/important to dive into. When leveraging automated tools for analysis consider their limiations. For example, are the YARA rules you're using from a well known repo or just something random you found on the internet?
