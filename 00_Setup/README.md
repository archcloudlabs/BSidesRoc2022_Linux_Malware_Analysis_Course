## Installing Vagrant & Setting Up Infrastructure
For the lab, we'll use Vagrant and quickly setup our environment for analysis.
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is a utility for managing Virtual Machines. You can find the installer's for your Operating System [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads). Vagrant makes it easy to create repeatable virtual machine environments, and we'll be using it for this course to provision a Ubuntu 20.04 Virtual Machine as our analysis machine. The particular box we're using is defined as ```config.vm.box``` .

```sh
  config.vm.box = "generic/ubuntu2004"
```

To mount this git project within the Virtual Machine, we'll leverage the ```config.vm.synced_folder``` directive. The code block below shows that we're mounting the git project (*one directory up from this file*) onto ```home/vagrant/bsides-roc-class``` path. This will make it easy for the course!

```sh
  config.vm.synced_folder "../", "/home/vagrant/bsides-roc-class"
```

In the code block below the "libvirt" vm provider is specified to spin up a Virtual Machine. If you're using Virtualbox, you should change this to, you guessed it "virtualbox". Vagrant supports numerous other providers which can be found in their official documentation [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/providers). Below the provider statement we're allocating 2GB of RAM for our virtual machine and.

```sh
   config.vm.provider "libvirt" do |vb|
     vb.memory = "2048"
   end
```

Currently, we're leveraging the "[shell](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/provisioning/shell)" provisioner which simply executes the commands listed within the *shell* variables in the Virtual machine. Numerous providers exist to provision virtual machines (Ansible, Chef, etc...), but for the time being we'll just keep things simple.

```sh
   config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
     apt-get update -y;
     apt-get install -y radare2 foremost scalpel vim;
   SHELL
```

## Starting Vagrant!
After making any modifications that you might have (provider/RAM/etc...), go forth and sping up your virtual machine! To start your VM, simply execute

``` sh
vagrant up
```

If the Vagrant virutal machine "generic/ubuntu2004" has not been downloaded, it'll take a second to download prior to executing the provision commands. However, afterwards it'll execute much faster. To check on the status of your virtual machine, execute "vagrant status". You should see something like the code block below showing that it's successfully running.

``` sh

☁  00_Setup [main] ⚡  vagrant status
Current machine states:

default                   running (libvirt)

The Libvirt domain is running. To stop this machine, you can run
`vagrant halt`. To destroy the machine, you can run `vagrant destroy`.
```

## Accessing your virtual machine.
We'll access the virtual machine via vagrant's built in-ssh command.
Vagrant leverages a private key it stores in "~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key" to perform ssh based authentication.

``` sh
vagrant ssh
```

If successful, you should find yourself with shell access to the vagrant machine and can now access the lab machine that will be used for the course.

```
☁  00_Setup [main] ⚡  vagrant ssh

```


## Destroying the Virtual Machine
When you're done, you can "clean up" by deleting the virtual machine via:
```sh
vagrant destroy
```
