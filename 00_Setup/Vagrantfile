  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
  # NOTE: This will enable public access to the opened port
  #config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 5601, host: 5601

  # within the machine from a port on the host machine and only allow access
  # via 127.0.0.1 to disable public access
  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080, host_ip: "127.0.0.1"

  # using a specific IP.
  #config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.122.10"

  # Create a public network, which generally matched to bridged network.

  # your network.

  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.

   config.vm.provider "libvirt" do |vb|
     vb.memory = "4096"

  # information on available options.
